# Test-Fire
An as yet unfinished 2D Unity Game.

A simple game targeting mobile devices. Makes heavy use of Unity's LineRenderer component for it's visuals, which aim to reproduce the look and feel of a 70's vector-based arcade game.

Players are tasked with taking control of the obstacles to get as far as they can in this twist on the standard mobile auto-runner.
